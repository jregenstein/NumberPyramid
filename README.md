# NumberPyramid
My solution to project Euler problem 67 (https://projecteuler.net/problem=67)
My original approach, which turned out to be innefficient and incorrect, involved making a custom data structure
to store the pyramid of numbers, with each number having links to the numbers around it, the extra classes are left
over from that approach.
